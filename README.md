## PYQT5 PROJECTS
I create various projects in Python using the PyQt5 framework and upload tutorial videos of them to YouTube (in Turkish). I'm planning to add English subtitles to some of my videos in the future.
### FOR SIMPLE PROJECTS:
- [Web Browser with Tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JHwtz0DNN8)
- [Pomodoro Timer (soon)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgHXeyLcYLE1baDPLyHAGA)
