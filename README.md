## PYQT5 PROJECTS
I write various projects in Python using the PyQt5 framework and upload lecture videos of these projects on YouTube (in Turkish). I have plans to add English subtitles to some videos in the future.
### FOR SIMPLE PROJECTS:

- [Pomodoro Timer (soon)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgHXeyLcYLE1baDPLyHAGA)
